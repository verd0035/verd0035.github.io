<article><h2>About me</h2></article>
<p>Hello my name is <abbr title="Dangerous Awesome Nice Killer Adventurous">Danika</abbr>Verdon, I enjoy reading and taking pictures. I first found my love for photography when my mothers boyfriend bought me my first camera. I enjoy reading romantic novels and love anything that involves conspiracies about what society could potentially be. I also love traveling and have been to lots of places around Canada, Europe, Dominican, Cuba and Florida.</p>
<p>A little more about myself, I grew up in Orleans and went to primary school at Arc en ciel and went to high school at Beatrice Desloges and decided to come to Algonquin as I thought it was the best choice for my future. I have 3 sisters and my parents are divorced. I also have a dog named Kenya. She is 5 years old and her birthday is October 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>
